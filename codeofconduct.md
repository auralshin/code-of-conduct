- Group members are not on the channel to discuss politics, avoid the subject, avoid using controversial avatars;
- The use of adult content in the form of videos, gifs, images or audio will not be tolerated;
- Inappropriate terms, intimidation, harassment, rude, offensive or disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated;
- Sexist, sexist, misogynistic or discriminatory jokes against minorities, people or groups will not be tolerated;

Those who do not respect such conduct will be warned (in private) and if the behavior persists, they will be removed from the group or channel.

# Values
These are the values to which people in the Hack Club community should aspire.

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
- Be thoughtful
- Be respectful
- Be charitable
- Avoid destructive behavior:
    - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
    - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
    - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
    - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
    - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.


# Intolerable behavior


- Expressing or provoking:
    - insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;
    - discrimination based on age, nationality, race, (dis)ability, gender (identity or expression), sexuality, religion, or similar personal characteristic;
    - bullying or systematic harassment;
    - unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.
- Excessive advertisement for unnecessary or non-beneficial commercial products and services.
- Posting spam-like content that disrupts the environment of the community.
