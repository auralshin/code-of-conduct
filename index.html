<h1 id="hacker-values">Hacker Values</h1>
<p>These are the values to which people in the Hack Club community should aspire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be friendly and welcoming</li>
<li>Be patient Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).</li>
<li>Be thoughtful Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted. Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.</li>
<li>Be respectful In particular, respect differences of opinion.</li>
<li>Be charitable Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree. When we do disagree, try to understand why.</li>
<li>Avoid destructive behavior:
<ul>
<li>Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.</li>
<li>Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.</li>
<li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)</li>
<li>Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.</li>
<li>Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="intolerable-behavior">Intolerable behavior</h1>
